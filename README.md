# Notes

- Multiple Pokemon will generally be referred to as Pokemons (mostly in the code)

# Planned Features

## Likely

- Gain 10gp per tile in your territory/under your control
- Each Pokemon will cost you upkeep (_`20gp?`_), they will never faint, but you can end up stuck on 0gp if you do not have enough tiles
  - _`20gp?`_ base form
  - _`50gp?`_ 2nd stage
  - _`100gp?`_ 3rd stage
- Pokemon cost _`100gp?`_ for base form
- Max spaces moved depends on Pokemons speed stat
- Show list of upto 4 attacks for each Pokemon when selected/attacking
- Add Abra (_`500gp?`_), can teleport anywhere on the map, cannot attack, low hp
- Evolve Pokemon somehow (xp, gp)
- Wild Pokemon to fight for xp (`Pidgey`, `Ratata`, `Weedle`, `Caterpie`)
- Return to base to heal (once per _`3?`_ turns)
- Hexes have biomes to boost types/attacks

## Need to decide

- Can attack after you move
  - **?** yes
  - **?** uses up 1 move
  - Once you attack you cannot move
- If your Pokemon or territory get cutoff from your base, your Pokemon will faint and the territory will become neutral
- Only gain income from biggest portion of territory

## Future Maybe

_These options could be implemented as game modifiers_

- Boss/Legendary Pokemon can randomly spawn on map, or always 1 in the center.
  - **?** Gives lots of XP
  - **?** Gives bonus _`500gp?`_
  - **?** Weaker version added to your team
  - **?** Will attack you if within _`2?`_ hex distance
- Add pokeballs
  - Can capture the wild Pokemon
    - Very low HP, can only move 1 space per turn
